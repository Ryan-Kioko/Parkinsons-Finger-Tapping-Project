# Parkinsons-Finger-Tapping-Project
This project aims to develop a computer-based assessment tool that analyzes finger tapping movements in Parkinson’s patients. Videos and signal data are used to measure how smoothly and quickly a patient taps their fingers, providing consistent insights into their motor control. This repository contains the relevant files used for this project.
